## History
The name Berger or *Lewis Berger* is today synonymous with colour worldwide. But actually the origin of the name dates back to over two & a half centuries in England in **1760**, when a young colour chemist named Lewis Berger, started manufacturing in Europe, 'Prussian blue' using a secret process that every designer and householder coveted. Mr. Berger perfected this process & art of the blue colour, which was the colour of most military uniforms of that time. Enriched by the imagination of Lewis Berger, the unending quest for creation and innovation in the world of colour & paints still continues.

If you get your home painted by a professional, they will fix any minor or major concerns, including waterproofing and weatherproofing, making sure any future wall concerns can be avoided completely.

**So if you want that a third party person should do the job for you, without your interfernce with some extra bucks from your pocket, then you should definitely go with Berger Paints otherwise not.**
